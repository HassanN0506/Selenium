Selenium Class 5

you can store urls as Strings, outside the class, and make them public static for easy access

Handling checkboxes and radiobutton:
-if you have only 1 checkbox or radio button, you can just click on it.
-if you have multiple choices: store them in List and loop through.

-not good to locate an element on a list by index, because if something is added all the index change


DropDowns
-dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of dropdowns:
-Single select
-Multiple select

Handling dropdowns:
1. click on dropdown, and then click on the option you want
2. using Select class
    -in order to use Select class, we need to make sure the dropdown has a Select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements, you store them inside a container
such as list, set, map, etc.
