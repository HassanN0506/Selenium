SELENIUM CLASS 02

What is a WebElement?
-ANYTHING we see on the webpage is considered to be a WebElement
examples: buttons, links, checkboxes, text boxes, etc.

What is HTML?
-HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
-DOM stands for Document Object Model
-It is the browser's internal view of the webpage
-AKA "Developer's tools", AKA "Dev tools"
-Document --> it can be stored like any document such as pdf, excel, etc.
-Object --> any line in HTML is considered an Object
-Model --> This is just a layout of the HTML

Locator:
-Is an address or a position of a web element on the webpage
-Is used to locate or identify the web elements on the webpage

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CSS Selector
- Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
-purple/light blue(in dark mode) = tags (button, input, div)
-brown/pastel blue(in dark mode) = attributes (name, class, id)
-blue/orange(in dark mode) = attributes value (any value the developers put in there)
-white (in dark mode) = visible text (visible to the WebDriver)


So, why do we need so many locators:
-Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements, so it's good to have options.
-Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes, so it's good to have options to
be able to locate the most specific value.
-Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
    ex: linkTest and partialLikText are only used for links.


IF 2 OR MORE ELEMENTS HAVE THE SAME ATTRIBUTE VALUES, SELENIUM WILL AUTOMATICALLY RUN WITH THE 1ST ONE


AN "a tag" IS ALSO CALLED AN "anchor tag" (link)
