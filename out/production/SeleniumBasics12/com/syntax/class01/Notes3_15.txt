SELENIUM CLASS 01

What is software testing?
-Identifying the "correctness" and Quality of the application

2 ways to test: -Manual and automated

When to go for automation:
-After manual testing is passed
(We ALWAYS START with a few MANUAL Tests, to ensure the application is stable)
-When environment is stable
-Analyze our test suite and choose our automation tools

What automation tools do we know about?
-Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Katalon Studio, UFT/QTP

Levels of Testing:
-Unit testing
-Integration testing
-Acceptance testing
-System testing

TYPES of testing:
-Functional
    -ensuring the FUNCTIONALITY of the application meets requirements
-NON-functional
    -performance testing (how much load can it handle?)
    -security testing

What is Selenium?
-A set of tools to help up automate web applications
-It is mainly used to perform functional testing

Selenium Components:
-Selenium IDE --> "Integrated Development Environment"
-Selenium Grid --> Firefox plugin
-Selenium WebDriver
-Selenium RC --> Remote control

What is Selenium WebDriver?
-An "open source"(free) automation tool that allows us to perform actions on web applications.
-WebDriver is an Interface

Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-Open source (free)
-Works with different browsers and supports cross browsing testing
-Works w/ different programming languages
-OS independent (works w/ all the operating systems)

Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:
-Works ONLY with web applications, so it cannot test desktop application
-No technical support
-No built-in reports
-Cannot test captcha, images, or videos

get() vs navigate()
-navigate() can go back and forward and can refresh
-get() will wait for the page to FULLY LOAD before moving on to the next line of code,
whereas navigate() will NOT!!!!!
-get() will NOT keep the HISTORY of the browser, whereas navigate() WILL

close() vs quit()
-close() will close the current TAB
-quit() will close the entire BROWSER

fullscreen() vs maximize()
-maximize() will maximize the browser's WINDOW, allowing you to still see the control panel
(back and forward buttons, bookmark menu, etc.)
-fullscreen() will maximize the TAB, not allowing you to see the control panel
