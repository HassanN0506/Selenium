selenium review 02

YOU CAN USE 'AND' AND 'OR' INSIDE XPATHS AND CSS
TO SPECIFY 2 OR MORE ATTRIBUTES

'isEnabled()' checks if you can click on it or not


advanced xpath:
get to the nearest sibling, parent, or ancestor first
and then have access to the desired tag

//label[@name="myid"]/following-sibling::input
-hey get me the tag with name "label", whose
attribute has the value of "myid".

//label[@name="myid"]/following-sibling::input
-once you are there, get me it's following singling,
who has a tag called "input"

following-sibling is sibling tag that comes after
preceding-sibling is the sibling tag that comes before

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

driver.findElement(By.xpath/css/name/is/tag/etc.(" "));


-Whenever we have dropdowns that are made using select class,
we can use select class in selenium to deal with them.
1. get to the select tag for the drop-down using driver.findElement
2. create an instance of select class and pass your WebElement
3. we can select any option by value/by visible text/by index
