Selenium Class 06

Alerts:
Alert is a pop-up message. Alert takes the complete focus of the main page that
we are working on, and we cannot proceed until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1. Web-based alerts/ html alerts
        -we can simply inspect and preform needed actions
2. Javascript alerts/ browser alerts
        -we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
        -we canNOT inspect these alerts
3. Windows based alerts
        -we canNOT handle with selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1. Simple alert - we can only click on 'ok' button
2. Confirmation alert - either click 'cancel' or click 'ok'
3. Prompt alert - enter the text and then click 'ok', or simply click 'cancel'

4 methods to handle JS alerts:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

To handle "Authentication alerts", we need to pass the username and password in the url
Syntax: https:// username:password@ restOfTheURL
Example: https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth


Frames:
-Frame is a separate, independent window in our webpage.
-Frames allow developers to represent multiple views on 1 page.

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

In alerts, we switch to alert, and then it switches back automatically.
But in frames, we switch to a frame manually, and switch manually BACK to the main page.


INTERVIEW QUESTION:
"How do you handle alerts in selenium?"
-We handle Alerts by using Alert interface.
