Selenium class 4

Whenever you see a NUMERIC character in the value of an attribute, it will
MOST LIKELY be changed in the near future, and so it is NOT RELIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!


CSS Selector (Cascading Style Sheet)
-it is another way of locating elements on the webpage
-syntax: tagName[attribute = 'attribute value']
-example: button[type = 'submit']

-CSS does not give an opportunity to locate an element by its text (only xpath can do that)

Shortcuts for CSS:
-Shortcut for ClassName --> "."
    syntax: tagname.classNameValue
    example: input.button

-Shortcut for ID --> "#"
    syntax: tagname#idValue
    example: input#twotabsearchtextbox


Contains() method in CSS:
* symbol represents contains method
    syntax: tagname[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']
    example: input[placeholder *= 'Email']

Starts-with method in CSS:
^ (caret) symbol represents starts-with method
    syntax: tagname[attribute ^= 'STARTING part of the attribute value']
    example: input[type ^= 'pass']

CSS also HAS end-with method (unlike xpath):
$ symbol represents ends-with method in CSS
        syntax: tagname[attribute $= 'ENDING part of the attribute value']
        example: input[type $= 'word']


Xpath vs CSS:
-xpath doesn't have ends-with method, and css does
-css has shortcuts
-css is FASTER than xpath   !!!!!
-css doesn't use //
-css CANNOT locate an element by its text, and xpath can    !!!!!
-there is no advanced css (there IS advanced xpath)
-css have a more simple syntax than xpath


WebElement Commands:
consists of several methods where we can perform an action
and get the element state on the webpage.

isEnabled() --  boolean value
isDisplayed() -- boolean value
isSelected() -- boolean value
getText() -- String value
getAttribute() -- String value
clear() -- void
submit() -- void
    -if the .submit() method causes the page to change, then it will wait until the page is loaded before continuing
    -but .click() will not wait until the new page is loaded!!!!!
