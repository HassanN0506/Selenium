Selenium Class 7

linkText must be trimmed in order to work!!!!!!


Handling multiple windows/tabs:

In order for us to handle multiple windows, we will be using:
    -getWindowHandle()
    -getWindowHandles()

Window Handle:
    -a unique ID that holds the address of a window or a tab
    -it is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Main Handle: the main page you're working on
Child handle: the tabs that came from the Main page (link to another page, etc.)

Whenever we store windowHandles in a 'set' using the getWindowsHandles() method,
it AUTOMATICALLY returns a LinkedHashSet. So it keeps the insertion order   !!!!!

Synchronization:
-The process of bringing the speed of 2 or more components to the same level.
    -In this case, we're bringing out script's execution and the page's loading to the same speed.

( Thread.sleep() is a "Static wait" AKA an "Unconditional wait")

Types of Selenium waits:
    -Implicit wait
    -Explicit wait
    -Fluent wait

Implicit wait AKA "Global wait":
-Tells WebDriver to wait for  certain amount of time BEFORE throwing an exception.
-It is only written once, and it is applied to the whole session of the execution.
-Works only w/ findElement() & findElements() methods.
-Usually set to 20 seconds.
-Usually implemented after navigating to the webpage.
-If the element is found before the given wait time, the remaining time is ignored.
-If the element is not found after the given time, only then will you get an exception.
