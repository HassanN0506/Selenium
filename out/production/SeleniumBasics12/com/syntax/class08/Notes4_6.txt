Selenium class 8

Wildcard:
-Starting an xPath with " //* restOfTheXpath".
-Instead of starting the xpath with a particular tagName,
    if we write the xpath like this (starting with //*),
    with a star in place of a tagName,
    it'll locate EVERY element that matches the rest of the xpath,
    no matter what the tagName is.
-So it's a way of making the xPath more DYNAMIC!!!!!
-' * ' is a wildcard. It can identify ANY tagName.
example: //*[starts-with(text(), 'Welcome')]
    -it'll locate every WebElement that has a text that starts with 'Welcome', no matter the tagName.

Implicit wait:
    -Will be applied for the 2 FindElement methods

Explicit wait (AKA "WedDriver Wait", in Selenium):
    -Is used to tell the WebDriver to wait for a certain condition, before throwing
        an exception for the specified condition.
    -Works with 'ExpectedConditions' class.
    -Waits until the specified conditions are met, or until the given time has run out.


Differences between implicit and explicit waits:
    -implicit wait is applied only when finding web elements.
    -implicit wait only waits until the element is Located (doesn't care what condition it's in)!!!!!

    -explicit wait is applied only when we write the code for it.
    -'explicit wait' waits until the specified condition of the WebElement is met!!!!!


FLUENT wait:
-Is a 'Global wait' like implicit wait (only write it once, and it is applied to the entire script).
-Used to tell the WebDriver to wait for certain condition(s), as well as its FREQUENCY,
    before throwing an exception.
-Usually gets set after navigating to the URL (just like Implicit wait)!!!!!


-Implicit wait -- waits to locate an element.
-Explicit wait -- waits until a condition is met.
-Fluent wait -- sets timeouts, sets polling frequency, and ignores specified exceptions in the given time period.

to go from a parent tag to its child, just type the parent's xpath, and add on: "/childTagName"!!!!!

WebTables:
-WebTables are elements as well on the webpage, which are constructed by having rows and columns.

Types of WebTables:
1. Static WebTable --Data is fixed/constant
2. Dynamic WebTable --Data changes

-WebTables consist of different sections or parts.
-Construction:
    <table> //table
        <thead> //table header
            <tr> //table row
                <th></th> //column data (header)
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody> //table body
            <tr>
                <td></td> //table data
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    //sometimes the 'header' is written as the 1st row inside the BODY!!!!!
